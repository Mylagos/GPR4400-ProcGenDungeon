"# GPR4400-ProcGenDungeon"

Game by Alexendre Baud, Edouard Baud and Aidan Ceunnet.

Game is a turn based dungeon crawler
You play as a magician girl that uses her fire powers to defeat her foes :D
You have two modes
-Play mode
  Play trough the game and defeat your enemies
-Visit castle
  Admire the smooth graphics and amazing procedural generation

There is a couple of bugs, some of which you may encounter during extended playtrough of the game.
We know about them, most of them are because of the turn based combat hopefully it won't cause too much of an issue for your playtrough.
We could have fixed them with a couple more hours but it is what it is :D
